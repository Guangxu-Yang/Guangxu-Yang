<h2>Communication Complexity of Key-Agreement with Perfect Completeness from Random Oracles</h2>
<p>(with Mi-Ying Huang, Xinyu Mao, and Jiapeng Zhang)  
</p>
<p>
Key-agreement protocols with provable security in the random oracle model (ROM) are an essential alternative to protocols based on public-key cryptography. In ROM, all parties, including the eavesdropper, have oracle access to a random function. 
The random oracle serves as an ideal hash function in symmetric cryptography. Hence, it is interesting to study the existence of key-agreement protocols in ROM. Unfortunately, as shown by Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC 1989) and Barak and Mahmoody (Crypto 2009), such protocols can only guarantee limited security: the key of any \(\ell\)-query protocol can be revealed by an \(O(\ell^2)\)-query adversary. This quadratic gap matches the existing key-agreement protocol proposed by Merkle (CACM 78), known as  Merkle's Puzzles. 
</p>
<p>	
Besides query complexity, the communication complexity of two-party protocols in ROM is also an important question in practice. A recent work by Haitner et al. (ITCS 2019) first observed that in Merkle's Puzzles, to obtain secrecy against an eavesdropper with \(O(\ell^2)\) queries, the honest parties need to exchange \(\Omega(\ell)\) bits. Therefore, they believed that high communication complexity seemed unavoidable. Concretely, they conjectured that any \(\ell\)-query protocols with \(c\) bits of communication could be attacked by an \(O(c\cdot \ell)\)-query adversary. This, if true, would suggest that Merkle's Puzzle is also optimal regarding communication complexity. Building upon some techniques from communication complexity, Haitner et al. (ITCS 2019) confirmed this conjecture for some particular protocols. 
</p>
<p>
This work affirms the above conjecture for all non-adaptive protocols with perfect completeness. Our proof uses a novel idea called density increment argument. This method could be of independent interest as it differs from previous communication lower bounds techniques in ROM  (and bypasses some technical barriers).
