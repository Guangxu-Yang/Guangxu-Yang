<h2>On Communication Complexity of Key Agreement Protocols in Random Oracle Model</h2>

<p>
Key-agreement protocols with provable security in the random oracle model (ROM) are an important alternative to protocols based on public-key cryptography. In ROM, all parties including the eavesdropper have access to a random oracle. The random oracle serves as an ideal hard function in symmetric cryptography. Unfortunately, as shown by Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC 1989) and Barak and Mahmoody (Crypto 2009), such protocols can only guarantee limited secrecy: the key of any \(\ell\)-query protocol can be revealed by an \(O(\ell^2)\)-query adversary. This quadratic gap between the query complexity of the honest parties and the eavesdropper matches the gap obtained by the protocol of Merkle (CACM ’78), known as  Merkle's Puzzles. Hence the current bound on the query complexity of key-agreement protocols is tight.
</p>
<p>	
Besides the query complexity, the communication complexity of multi-party protocols in ROM is also an important question in practice. A recent work by Iftach et al. (ITCS 2019) observed that: in Merkle’s Puzzles, to obtain secrecy against an eavesdropper that makes roughly \(\ell^2\) queries, the honest parties need to exchange \(\Omega(\ell)\) bits. They suggested that high communication complexity seems unavoidable in the construction of provable secure key-agreement protocols. Concretely, they made the following conjecture: any \(\ell\)-query protocols with \(c\) number of communication bits are only secure to an \(O(c\cdot \ell)\)-query adversary. This suggests that Merkle’s Puzzle is also tight in terms of communication complexity. Builds upon some techniques for proving communication complexity lower bounds, Iftach et al. (ITCS 2019) confirmed this conjecture for some special protocols.
</p>
<p>
In this work, we affirm their conjecture for all non-adaptive protocols with perfect completeness, even the random function is a random permutation. To prove our result, we introduce a novel idea called \textit{density increment arguments}. This approach is inspired by a new interpretation of information complexity by Yang and Zhang (Manuscript 2023). We believe our method is of independent interest as it bypasses some barriers that incapacitate previous techniques for proving communication lower bounds (in ROM). It also has a good chance to prove communication lower bound for general protocols with imperfect completeness as well as proving communication complexity lower bounds for other types of protocols.
