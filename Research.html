<h2>Lifting Theorems Meet Information Complexity: Set Disjointness</h2>
<p>(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jiapeng0708/home" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Jiapeng Zhang</a>)
</p>
<p>
Information complexity and lifting theorems are two most powerful frameworks with many applications in different areas. However, the connections between information complexity and lifting theorems are less clear. In this paper, we adopt the idea of Raz-McKenzieâ€™s simulation [RM99,GPW15] to obtain new proofs for randomized \(\Omega(n)\) communication lower boound of set disjointness and optimal \(\Omega(n/k)\) lower bound on the deterministic(and randomized) communication complexity of the k-party set disjointness function with the unique intersection promise in the blackboard model which give a unified, less ad-hoc way of proving communication lower bounds for \(k\text{-}\mathrm{UDISJ}\). Our proofs may firstly build the connections between corruption bound, information complexity and lifting theorems.

<h2>Simulation Methods in Communication Complexity, Revisited</h2>
<p>(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jiapeng0708/home" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Jiapeng Zhang</a>)
</p>
<p>
The notion of lifting theorems is a generic method to lift hardness of one-party functions to two-party lower bounds in communication model. It has many applications in different areas such as proof complexity, game theory, combinatorial optimization. Among many lifting results, a central idea is called Raz-McKenize simulation (FOCS 1997). This simulation provides a systematic way to convert a communication protocol into a corresponding decision tree. Though it is very convenient in many applications, there are still some challenges in this framework. A major problem is that Raz-McKenize simulation requires a very large gadget.
<\p>
<p>
In this paper, we revise Raz-McKenzie simulation. We introduce a white-box simulation, proving lifting theorems for block sensitivity with constant-size gadgets. Concretely, we show there is a constant-size gadget \(g\) such that for any Boolean function \(f\), the corruption bound of \(f\circ g^n\) is lower bounded by \(\Omega(bs(f))\). Combined with a result of Beame et al. (CCC 2005), this implies the randomized communication complexity of \(f\circ g^n\) is lower bounded by \(\Omega(bs(f))\). Besides the result itself, we believe our simulation technique may have more applications in diverse areas. We also discuss why our simulation method has a potential to avoid the large-size gadget bottleneck in Raz-McKenzie simulation.
